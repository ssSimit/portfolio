        longDesc: `Indoor AR Navigation is an
    indoor navigation app built for multi-department institutions — government offices, hospitals,
    colleges — where finding a specific room is
    genuinely hard. Built for HackFusion, an inter-college innovation
    hackathon, as part of a three-person team.

    The core system detects a tracked image marker to anchor a 3D blockout
    model of the building, then uses Unity's NavMesh to calculate a live
    path to a user-selected destination, rendered as a line the user can
    follow in AR. Room selection is handled through a dynamically
    generated UI. Multi-floor navigation is designed around swapping in
    separate NavMesh prefabs per floor marker.`,
